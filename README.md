I am bad at naiming things I know... this is a repo to investigate can messages and communication on a car. 

the target car is a 2020 corolla. 

goals for this project are to:
* examples for receiving and decoding can messages
* providing a readout for key vehicle information 
* experiment with python and c++ libraries 

Key libraries:
